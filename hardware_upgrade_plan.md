# Hardware Upgrade Plan for Yoco Model Training

## Current Hardware
- CPU: AMD EPYC 7571
- Memory: 7936MiB
- Storage: Amazon Elastic Block Store

## Potential AWS EC2 Instance Types for Accelerated Training

### GPU-Optimized Instances

1. p3.2xlarge
   - GPU: 1 NVIDIA V100 GPU
   - vCPUs: 8
   - Memory: 61 GiB
   - Suitability: Excellent for deep learning tasks
   - Cost-effectiveness: High performance but relatively expensive

2. g4dn.xlarge
   - GPU: 1 NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPU
   - vCPUs: 4
   - Memory: 16 GiB
   - Suitability: Good for machine learning workloads
   - Cost-effectiveness: More affordable than P3, good balance of price and performance

### Machine Learning-Specific Instances

3. inf1.xlarge
   - Accelerator: 1 AWS Inferentia chip
   - vCPUs: 4
   - Memory: 8 GiB
   - Suitability: Optimized for machine learning inference
   - Cost-effectiveness: Excellent for inference tasks, may not be ideal for training

4. trn1.2xlarge
   - Accelerator: 1 AWS Trainium chip
   - vCPUs: 8
   - Memory: 32 GiB
   - Suitability: Designed specifically for machine learning training
   - Cost-effectiveness: Potentially very high for training tasks

### High-Performance CPU Instances

5. c6i.8xlarge
   - CPU: 32 vCPUs (Intel Xeon Scalable 3rd Gen)
   - Memory: 64 GiB
   - Suitability: Good for compute-intensive tasks
   - Cost-effectiveness: More affordable than GPU instances, but may not provide the same level of acceleration for deep learning

## Evaluation and Recommendations

1. For fastest training times: p3.2xlarge or trn1.2xlarge
   - These instances offer the highest performance for deep learning training tasks
   - Consider the trade-off between cost and training time reduction

2. For balanced performance and cost: g4dn.xlarge
   - Offers good GPU acceleration at a more affordable price point
   - Suitable for both training and inference tasks

3. For CPU-based training: c6i.8xlarge
   - If GPU acceleration is not critical, this instance type offers high CPU performance
   - More cost-effective than GPU instances but may result in longer training times

## Next Steps

1. Obtain AWS credentials to configure the AWS CLI
2. Once authenticated, use the following command to get detailed pricing information:
   ```
   aws pricing get-products --service-code AmazonEC2 --filters "Type=TERM_MATCH,Field=instanceType,Value=<instance-type>"
   ```
3. Test the model training process on different instance types to benchmark performance improvements
4. Evaluate the actual cost-benefit ratio based on reduced training time and instance costs
5. Select the most suitable instance type based on performance requirements and budget constraints

Note: Actual performance improvements may vary depending on the specific characteristics of the Yoco model and the dataset size. It's recommended to perform benchmarks with a subset of the data on different instance types before making a final decision.
